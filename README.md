Welcome ALPHA Augmented Recruiting Team:
========================================

The program module Tetris_Sorting_WPF is written that can take as input a collection of Tetris pieces and a container,then places the pieces inside the container at the next available space (from the bottom left corner) and finally returns the resulting configuration.


### Below are the satisfied condition: (All the mentioned Constrains)


1. In the input, the container is represented by two values M and N;
2. In the input, the Tetris pieces are represented by 10 multi-dimensional arrays;
3. The algorithm should place the pieces in the order they are specified in the input. Starting from the lower left corner, from left to right, from bottom to top;
4. This Program is written in C# as per the request ;


### Instruction:

1. When you run the setup file and program UI will be displayed. 
2. Specify the container Row and column and click on "Initialize Container". 
3. Now Select the option number as perthe input reuiremnt given.
4. There is also "Rotate" input - 1 means rotate the selected option 90 degree - 2 means rotate the selected option 180 degree - 3 means rotate the selected option 270 degree.
5. click on "ADD" to add the input tetris in container. You will see the input option and rotation as preview and also added into container.
6. click on "CLEAR" to clear the container.


### Extra Activities for Consideration:

1. The continuos development is not just saying implemented it as conventional day to day development via git.
2. Setup up unit testing which can be further improved and facilitated Continuously Integration and development.
3. Created a simple CI Pipeline.
4. Abid all the requirement. Simple is always the must and best. Therefore provided simple logic of placinf the tetris on the next available space. 
5. On personnel interest shared a github link for this project where the complexity is little increased and trying to improve solution by rotating the tetris within the container to find the best fit and so on.


### To Run the File:

click on the setup file, it will open a UI window after running, If it ask for permission please provide.
